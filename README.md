# FrameCutter
I use this code for run my sh and cut frames from video-files

So this app check hot folder and add all files to queue at Thread Pool Executer.

# Instructions
1. Create youScript.sh

at your Script must be three variables:
- $1 = path to file
- $2 = path to result folder
- $3 = custom

2. Run it and type the key: sh script, path to hot folder, path to result folder, third variable;

while it works you can add a new files in hot folder for processing
